        <h2>Avatar: The Phenomenon</h2>
        <p>The first Avatar movie follows Jake Sully, a Marine who traveled to the alien planet of Pandora and operates an "Avatar", a genetically engineered body that allows the human race to interact with the alien Na'vi species sent by a corporation to exploit Pandora's natural resources. But as Jake forms a bond with the Na'vi, he must decide whether he wishes to side with these people, or remain loyal to his employers.</p>
        <p>Beyond the story, the film set a new standard for Visual Effects using both CGI and immersive VFX, along with that, it pioneered a virtual camera system that filmed fully digitally inside the digital world in real time. All these elements resulted in the film becoming the highest-grossing movie of all time, not only in the domestic market but internationally.</p>

        <p class="gap-text">This visualization highlights the countries that contributed most to Avatar’s international earnings, making the differences between markets easy to understand. Countries appear along the vertical axis so that even long names remain readable, while the horizontal bars illustrate revenue amounts clearly and proportionally. The layout quickly draws attention to major performers, and China, France, and Japan stand out as essential pillars of the film’s overseas success. What this chart communicates especially well is the balance between regions and the extent to which the film depended on international viewership. By organizing countries side-by-side, the chart allows for immediate comparison and helps uncover the geographic patterns behind the film’s massive box office performance.

      <h2>Avatar: The Phenomenon</h2>
      <p>With all the excitement surrounding the movie, one question we had was about the staying experience of the film, looking at the ticket sales over time, and comparing them with other films with similar levels of excitement. The goal for this analysis was to see if the film had any staying power after the hype of the initial release.</p>

       <p class="gap-text">Looking at Avatar’s first 25 weeks in theatres shows how the film maintained audience interest far beyond its opening weekend. The timeline along the bottom captures the rhythm of its theatrical run, while the revenue scale on the left shows weekly earnings as they rise and fall. What stands out is the film’s remarkable stability: after a strong start, the decline in weekly revenue is gradual rather than sharp, indicating strong word-of-mouth and repeated viewings. This long-tail performance helps explain why Avatar climbed to record-breaking totals that it not only opened well but continued drawing viewers over several months. A line graph works well for this data because it clearly reveals trends and momentum, allowing viewers to see how engagement evolved over time.
