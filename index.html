        <p class="section-text">
          The Avatar movies, along with being international sensations, also reflect a variety of trends that emerged in Hollywood with the rise of storytelling techniques and technologies between the two movies. Along with that, the films were released during two different eras of the entertainment industry, with the change in attitudes toward the theater experience between the two releases, as well as the call for more diversity in our films. These movies are a great case study of Hollywood and the trends of the entertainment industry as a whole.

      <div class="chart-wrapper">
        <div id="observablehq-geoMap-f536d361"></div>
        <p class="gap-text">The world map offers a broad look at how Avatar (2009) performed across global markets, making it easy to see where the film gained the most traction. Darker shades of blue highlight countries with the highest box office totals, while lighter tones represent more modest earnings. This spatial design allows patterns to emerge naturally that viewers can quickly spot regions such as China, Australia, Brazil, and much of Western Europe as major contributors. By displaying the information geographically, the map communicates reach and impact in a way that numerical tables simply can’t. The legend ties each color to actual revenue values, helping viewers interpret scale at a glance. As the opening visual for the website, it sets the stage by emphasizing Avatar’s identity as a global phenomenon and introduces the project's focus on how audiences around the world responded to the film.

    <div class="bottom-text">
      <h2 class="center-text top">New Technologies</h2>
      <p class="gap-text">The Avatar franchise showcases one of the fastest periods of technological evolution in film history. The first movie changed Hollywood by bringing 3D cinema, motion capture, and virtual production into the mainstream. It introduced a new kind of digital filmmaking that allowed directors to “step inside” a CGI world while shooting.
       More than a decade later, The Way of Water pushed these innovations even further. The sequel introduced advanced facial capture systems, more detailed CGI environments, and groundbreaking underwater performance capture that had never been done before. For audiences, these technologies created a deeper sense of immersion. The visual improvements between the two films show how strongly technology influences audience reactions and expectations for epic sci-fi storytelling.

    <!-- Theater Information Section -->
    <div class="bottom-text">
      <h2 class="center-text top">Theater Information</h2>
      <p class="gap-text">The movie-going landscape changed dramatically between 2009 and 2022. When the first Avatar was released, theaters were thriving. People saw movies in cinemas much more often, and 3D experiences felt exciting and new. By the time Avatar 2 arrived, the world had changed. Streaming services grew extremely popular, many viewers became comfortable watching films at home, and COVID-19 disrupted theater attendance around the world. Some international markets recovered quickly, while others reopened more slowly. These conditions give important context when comparing audience reactions to both films. They help us understand why certain regions performed differently, why ticket sales changed, and how the movie industry shifted over time.
