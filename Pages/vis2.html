        <h2>The Way of Water</h2>
        <p>Avatar: The Way of Water follows the family of Jake Sully and Neytiri as they face a renewed human threat. To protect their children, they seek refuge with the ocean tribe of the Na'vi. The conflict escalates and forces the Sully family into a battle that tests their bonds and their newfound community. The film expands Pandora's world while exploring themes of family, survival, and belonging.</p>
        <p>The film used new technologies as well, pioneering true underwater performance capture, allowing actors' movements to be recorded accurately beneath the surface for the first time. The film also used advanced facial capture systems and AI water simulations, resulting in highly realistic ocean environments and creature interactions. Together, these innovations helped expand the visual realism of Pandora and set a new standard for digital filmmaking.</p>

      <h2>Avatar 2: The Phenomenon</h2>
      <p>Released over a decade after the original, Avatar: The Way of Water faced the challenge of living up to unprecedented expectations. Despite streaming's rise and changing theater habits, the sequel proved that audiences still craved epic cinematic experiences, becoming one of the highest-grossing films of all time.</p>

      <h2>Staying Power Analysis</h2>
      <p>One of the most interesting aspects of Avatar: The Way of Water's box office performance was its remarkable longevity. Unlike many modern blockbusters that see steep drops after opening weekend, the sequel demonstrated sustained audience interest week after week, suggesting that word-of-mouth and the immersive experience drew repeat viewers and late adopters.</p>

        <p class="gap-text">The weekly performance of The Way of Water shows a distinct pattern compared to the 2009 release. The film opens with a dramatic revenue spike, signaling strong anticipation and brand loyalty built over more than a decade. From there, the numbers drop more quickly, reflecting modern viewing habits where moviegoers front-load attendance during opening weeks. The timeline across the bottom allows viewers to follow these shifts, while the revenue scale on the left quantifies each week’s contribution. The sharper decline contrasts with the original film’s slow fade and highlights how the cinematic landscape has changed, and streaming options, competition, and post-pandemic behaviours all play a role. Despite the faster drop-off, the high early weeks were enough to generate substantial totals, showing that the sequel succeeded through intensity rather than duration.
